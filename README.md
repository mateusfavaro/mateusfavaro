I'm passionate about technology since childhood, even though my first degree was in Law. I graduated in 2021 and worked exclusively in the legal field for some time.

Over the years, I decided to transition into tech and started studying **back-end development**, and later **front-end** as well.

Today, I work as a **Full-Stack .NET developer** at a company focused on building systems for public fund accountability and service monitoring.
